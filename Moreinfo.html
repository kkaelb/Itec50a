      <h2>Our Story</h2>
      <p>
        Café Haven was founded in 2025 with a simple idea: to bring people together over quality coffee.
        What began as a small neighborhood café has grown into a beloved spot for coffee lovers who crave authentic flavors and a cozy, welcoming atmosphere.
        Our journey is built on passion, community, and a love for exceptional brews.

        We've expanded not just in space but in heart — embracing every guest like family and constantly refining our craft.
        Each cup we serve is a celebration of carefully sourced beans, thoughtful preparation, and the joy of sharing moments.
        Whether you're here for a quiet morning, an afternoon chat, or a quick pick-me-up, Café Haven offers a space where time slows down and connections are brewed.

        From fresh pastries to hearty bites, every item on our menu is made with care — designed to pair perfectly with your favorite cup.
        As we continue to grow, our mission remains the same: to be your daily escape, your local go-to, and your cozy corner in a busy world.

      <h2>Our Coffee</h2>
      <p>
        We source our coffee beans from small farms across Latin America, Africa, and Southeast Asia. 
        Each batch is roasted in-house to bring out the unique character of the beans — from nutty and 
        chocolaty to fruity and floral. Whether you prefer a bold espresso or a smooth cold brew, 
        there's something for every palate at Café Haven.

      <h2>Sustainability Matters</h2>
      <p>
        Cafe Haven is committed to environmental responsibility. We use biodegradable cups, encourage reusable 
        containers, and partner with suppliers who prioritize ethical farming practices. Our goal is not 
        only to serve great coffee but to protect the planet with every cup we brew.
